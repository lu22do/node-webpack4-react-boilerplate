This is a basic javacsript (es6) fullstack boilerplate for a server in nodejs and client in webpack4+react.

# Client/Server stack

This setup uses one package.json for both client and server.
The client relies on Webpack to extract the required libraries to include in the client.
In dev mode, the server relies on nodemon to restart.

## Server
Uses expressjs, nodemon & babel.

## Client
Uses react, babel & webpack.
